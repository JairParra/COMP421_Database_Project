# COMP421_Database_Project

Creation from scratch of an database from scratch for a real world application. Step by step, you will design a schema, create a database using DB2/PostgreSQL, populate your database with data, maintain, query and update your data, develop application programs, and implement a user-friendly interface.

## Description 
- The purpose of this application is to introduce a dating system different to any others: a date rental service. Instead of putting time and effort in looking for a date, in which some cases people are not willing or feel unable to put in, we want to offer them the possibility of renting a suitable dating partner with certain desired characteristics. Consider for instance, an event in which going alone would be rather awkward; rent a date of your liking instead! Sometimes people feel lonely and would simply like some companies to do their preferred activities: walking around a park, going to a restaurant or a cinema, talk at a caf√©, etc. We propose an interactive platform in which people can do this easily.

## Connection instructions: 

Server information:  
- host: `comp421.cs.mcgill.ca`
- Linux account name: `cs421g88` 
- password: `<our group's password>`

ex. connection:  
`ssh comp421.mcgill.ca -l cs421g88`  

`password: ********`

`cs421g88@comp421 ~ $bash`

Database information: 
- Once inside the server, connect to `postgresql` as follows: 

`psql cs421` 

`password: <same_as_above>` 

## Database creation: 

- Please run the following creation (SQL) scriptsin the following order: 

    1. `table_creation.sql`
    2. `1_usertable_insertions.sql` 
    3. `2_mate_insertions.sql` 
    4. `3_customer_insertions.sql` 
    5. `4_manager_insertions.sql`
    6. `5_application_insertions.sql` 
    7. `6_request_insertions.sql`
    8. `7_order_insertions.sql` 
    9. `8_invoice_insertions.sql` 
    10. `9_startTable_insertions.sql`
    11. `10_activity_insertions.sql` 
    12. `11_modify_insertions.sql` 
    13. `12_generate_insertions.sql` 
    14. `13_schedule_insertions.sql`

where the first script is in `scripts/database_creation/` and the rest are in `scripts/table_insertions/` . 
Script 1 is was randomly generated, subsequent table creation scripts were generated using the `table_insertions_script.py` script.

## User-interface 
- The relevant files are located under the `user_interface` directory. Files descriptions can be found in the respective README.md
- Currently, application will only be emulated locally, but the intention is that it will eventually be available online as well. For this reason, HTML scripts are also placed as well.
