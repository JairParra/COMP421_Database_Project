# COMP421_Database_Project

Creation from scratch of an database from scratch for a real world application. Step by step, you will design a schema, create a database using DB2/PostgreSQL, populate your database with data, maintain, query and update your data, develop application programs, and implement a user-friendly interface.

## Description 
- The purpose of this application is to introduce a dating system different to any others: a date rental service. Instead of putting time and effort in looking for a date, in which some cases people are not willing or feel unable to put in, we want to offer them the possibility of renting a suitable dating partner with certain desired characteristics. Consider for instance, an event in which going alone would be rather awkward; rent a date of your liking instead! Sometimes people feel lonely and would simply like some companies to do their preferred activities: walking around a park, going to a restaurant or a cinema, talk at a caf√©, etc. We propose an interactive platform in which people can do this easily.
